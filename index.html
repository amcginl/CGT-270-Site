        <p>Our topic for this project is the Opioid Epidemic and we will use quantitative reasoning to determine the leading causes of the opioid epidemic and why specific groups are more targeted.</p>
        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>Why are certain groups impacted more than others by the opioid epidemic?</p>

        <p>Answer: </p>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Describe the team’s focus/goal related to the challenge,  Who’s the audience? What assumptions are made?</p>
        <p>The team’s goal for this challenge was to provide insight on the effect of the opioid epidemic on different demographics. The audience for this visualization is anyone concerned with the opioid epidemic, including government officials, doctors, pharmacists, and public health experts. Assumptions made for this challenge are that all data was collected accurately and ethically. </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>    
        <p>Describe the team’s data visualization workflow and process.</p>
        <p>Mediocre at Best has used GroupMe to remain organized, communicate meetings, and update the group on progress. During these meetings we divide tasks between individuals to be completed by the agreed time. This has worked very well for us, and we have met each deadline without issues. </p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>What insights are presented? What recommendations did the team make?</p>
        <p>When it comes to insights, we have found that men have more deaths from opioids and are more affected than women. Another insight can be drawn from our map visualization is that southern states such as people from Arkansas are more severely impacted by deaths/non fatal stuff which one could infer is attributed to a variety of factors such as economic, ease of access, and internal factors. These insights could lead our target audience of government officials to direct efforts toward men/middle age people/southern people in order to help with the opioid epidemic.</p>
